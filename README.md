## Abstract
This project applies Lean methods and discrete-event simulation (Arena) to optimize container stacking and yard operations at the Port of Oran. The aim was to reduce crane re-handles, lower container dwell time, and increase throughput by redesigning stacking logic and yard layout. The thesis shows measurable improvements in handling efficiency and waiting times through redesigned stacking rules and operational standards.

##  Problem statement
Port container yards suffer from inefficient stacking strategies that cause unnecessary re-handles, longer crane travel, increased operational cost, and higher dwell times. This project investigated stacking logic and yard layout alternatives to minimize re-handles while maintaining or increasing throughput.

---

##  Objectives
- Reduce crane re-handling moves.
- Decrease container dwell time.
- Increase yard throughput with minimal additional resources.
- Provide implementable SOPs and visual management for yard teams.

---

##  Methodology
1. **Process mapping & value-stream analysis** (Lean)  
2. **Data gathering**: yard flows, arrival schedules, crane moves, container types.  
3. **Model building**: discrete-event simulation using **Arena** (parameters: arrival rates, service times, stacking rules).  
4. **Scenario testing**: compare baseline vs. multiple stacking logic strategies.  
5. **Validation & sensitivity analysis**: check robustness across demand scenarios.  
6. **Recommendations & SOPs** for implementation.

---

##  Key Results
- **Crane re-handles decreased by ~30%** in the preferred scenario.  
- **Container dwell time reduced** (project measured X% average reduction vs baseline — replace X with actual figure).  
- Improved throughput per crane and smoother yard traffic patterns.  
- A practical implementation roadmap with SOPs and visual guides for yard staff.

> **Note:** Replace `X` above with the exact percentage from your thesis results if you prefer.

- **Excel** (data processing & scenario inputs)  
- **Power BI** (dashboards & KPI visualization)  
- **Lean tools** (VSM, 5S, Kaizen, root cause analysis)
